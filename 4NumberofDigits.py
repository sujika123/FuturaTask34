# Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.

n = int(input("Enter the number : "))

count=0

while(n>0):

    count = count+1
    n = n//10

print("The number of digits in the number are:",count)




# Program Explanation
# 1. User must first enter the value of the integer and store it in a variable.
# 2. The while loop is used and the last digit of the number is obtained by using the modulus operator.
# 3. Each time a digit is obtained, the count value is incremented.
# 4. This loop terminates when the value of the number is 0.
# 5. The total count of the number of digits is printed.
